# Linear Model Grid Search

**linear_model_grid_search** is a Python project that demonstrates how to perform hyperparameter tuning for linear regression models using GridSearchCV. This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that walks through building linear models, tuning their parameters, and evaluating their performance step-by-step.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to teach how to use GridSearchCV to optimize linear regression models. Using Pythonâ€™s scikit-learn library, the project covers:

- Loading and preprocessing data  
- Defining linear regression models  
- Performing grid search for hyperparameter tuning  
- Evaluating model performance with appropriate metrics  
- Visualizing results for better understanding  

This project provides a practical example of improving linear model performance through systematic hyperparameter tuning.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is provided in the file `AMES_Final_DF.csv`. It is a cleaned version of the Ames Housing dataset, commonly used for house price prediction tasks.

- Contains various features describing houses (e.g., size, location, quality)  
- The target variable is typically the house sale price
